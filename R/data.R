#' Karate club social network of Zachary (1977)
#'
#'
#' Zachary (1977) reported observations of social relations in a university
#' karate club, with membership that varied between 50 and 100, of whom 34
#' individuals: 32 ordinary club members and officers, the club president
#' ("John A."), and the part-time instructor ("Mr. Hi"); consistently
#' interacted outside of the club. Over the course of the study, the club
#' divided into two factions, and, ultimately, split into two clubs, one led by
#' Hi and the other by John and the original club's officers. The split was
#' driven by a disagreement over whether Hi could unilaterally change the level
#' of compensation for his services.
#'
#' Zachary identifies the faction with which each of the 34 actors was aligned
#' and how strongly and reports, for each pair of actors, the count of social
#' contexts in which they interacted. The 8 contexts recorded were \itemize{
#' \item academic classes at the university; \item Hi's private karate studio
#' in his night classes; \item Hi's private karate studio where he taught on
#' weekends; \item student-teaching at Hi's studio; \item the university
#' rathskeller (bar) located near the karate club; \item a bar located near the
#' university campus; \item open karate tournaments in the area; and \item
#' intercollegiate karate tournaments. }
#'
#' The highest number of contexts of interaction for a pair of individuals that
#' was observed was 7.
