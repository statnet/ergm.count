\title{Fit, Simulate and Diagnose Exponential-Family Models for Networks with Count
Edges}
\description{
\code{\link[=ergm.count-package]{ergm.count}} is a set of extensions to
package \code{\link[=ergm-package]{ergm}} to fit and simulate from
exponential-family random graph models for networks whose edge weights are
counts. For a list of functions type \code{help(package='ergm')} and
\code{help(package='ergm.count')}
}
\details{
Mainly, it implements Poisson, binomial, geometric, and discrete uniform
dyadwise reference measures for valued ERGMs
(\link[=ergm-references]{documented here}), and provides some count-specific
change statistics (\link[=ergm-terms]{documented here}).

For a complete list of the functions, use \code{library(help="ergm")} and
\code{library(help="ergm.count")} or read the rest of the manual.

When publishing results obtained using this package, please cite the
original authors as described in \code{citation(package="ergm.count")}.

All programs derived from this package must cite it.

This package contains functions specific to using \code{\link{ergm}} to
model networks whose dyad values are counts. Examples include counts of
conversations, messages, and other interactions.

In particular, this package implements the Poisson, geometric, binomial, and
discrete uniform reference measures (documented in
\code{\link{ergm-references}}) for use by \code{\link{ergm}} and
\code{\link{simulate.ergm}} to fit models from this family, as well as
statistics specific to modeling counts, such as the \code{\link{CMP}} for
the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Distribution.

newsgroup, references and links to further resources are provided there.
